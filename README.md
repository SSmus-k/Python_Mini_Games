🐍 Python Mini Games

Python Mini Games is a personal practice repository focused on learning Python through small, interactive games.
The project explores core Python concepts alongside beginner-friendly libraries such as Tkinter for GUIs and Pygame for game logic, animation, and event handling.

Rather than building one large application, this repository is organized as a collection of mini projects, each designed to strengthen a specific skill like control flow, object-oriented programming, user input handling, and basic game mechanics.

The goal of this project is learning-by-building. Every game starts simple and evolves with improvements such as graphical interfaces, better structure, and cleaner code. This makes the repository a growing reference for both practice and revision.
